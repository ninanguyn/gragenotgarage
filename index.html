<h2>Good Luck, Babe!</h2>
<p>It's fine, it's cool<br>
You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth<br>
And guess I'm the fool<br>
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof</p><br>

<p id="pfft" class="highlight">I don't wanna call it off<br>
But you don't wanna call it love<br>
You only wanna be the one that I call baby</p><br>

<p class="highlight">You can kiss a hundred boys in bars<br>
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling<br>
You can say it's just the way you are<br>
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason<br>
Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>
Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feeling</p>

<p>I'm clich√©, who cares?<br>
It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair<br>
And I cry, it's not fair<br>
I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air</p>

<p>Think I'm gonna call it off<br>
Even if you call it love<br>
I just wanna love someone who calls me baby</p>

<p>You can kiss a hundred boys in bars<br>
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling<br>
You can say it's just the way you are<br>
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason<br>
Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>
Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feeling</p>

<p class="highlight">When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night<br>
With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife<br>
And when you think about me, all of those years ago<br>
You're standing face to face with I told you so<br>
You know I hate to say it, I told you so<br>
You know I hate to say it but I told you so</p>

<p>You can kiss a hundred boys in bars<br>
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (well, I told you so)<br>
You can say it's just the way you are<br>
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason<br>
Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>
Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)<br>
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feeling<br>
You'll have to stop the world just to stop the feeling</p>
